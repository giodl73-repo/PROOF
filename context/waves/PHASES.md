# MDLOOM Wave Phases

> Find the first row with `status: active`; that is the work rail for
> `/mdloom-wave next` and `/mdloom-pulse`.

MDLOOM keeps public release meaning in `CHANGELOG.md`. Waves are the execution
record beneath that history: each wave has a mission, pulses, gates, reviews,
close notes, and the artifacts that changed the system.

Completed May 15 micro-waves that contained only a closeout are consolidated in
[`2026-05-15-CLOSEOUT-LEDGER.md`](2026-05-15-CLOSEOUT-LEDGER.md). Multi-file
waves retain their original directories.

## Operating Model

Each active wave keeps:

- `WAVE.md`: mission, scope, pulse table, gates, and carry-forwards.
- `pulses/NN+slug.md`: one executable slice with frontmatter, deliverables,
  validation, and non-goals.
- `forks/`: materialized pulse context for agent execution when needed.
- `panels/`: role reviews and consolidated findings.
- `CLOSE.md`: written when the wave is complete.

## Pulse Rules

- A pulse must be independently reviewable and testable.
- Every pulse names governing roles and validation commands.
- Quality claims must be explicit: mechanical proof, Rust tests, docs contract
  review, or deferred carry-forward.
- Completed pulses keep their checkboxes checked; future pulses remain open.
- Wave status only advances after docs, tests, and review findings agree.

## History Bridge

- `CHANGELOG.md` remains the release-history source of truth.
- Backfilled history cites existing release notes and artifacts rather than
  pretending a wave plan existed before the work.
- Closeout may recommend changelog entries, but release notes should stay
  semver-oriented.
